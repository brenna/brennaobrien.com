<p>“<em>I briefly forgot that I can accomplish anything if I’ve got good music playing. Let’s not do that again.</em>” - <a href="https://twitter.com/brennaob/status/264131523333197825">a couple months ago</a></p>

<p>Though I constantly lamented the lack of new music I’d been listening to this year, and even at times, feared a good-music drought was upon us, it turns out the situation was not so bleak.</p>

<p>When I finally took stock and attempted Ye Olde Top 10 List, I once again came out with at least 20 great albums. This is the music that moved me the most:</p>

<ol>
<li> <em>Grimes</em> – Visions</li>
<li> <em>Father John Misty</em> – Fear Fun</li>
<li> <em>Frank Ocean</em> – Channel Orange</li>
<li> <em>Grizzly Bear</em> – Shields</li>
<li> <em>Sharon Van Etten</em> – Tramp</li>
<li> <em>Kendrick Lamar</em> – Good Kid M.A.A.D. City</li>
<li> <em>Yeasayer</em> – Fragrant World</li>
<li> <em>Flying Lotus</em> – Until the Quiet Comes</li>
<li> <em>Twin Shadow</em> – Confess</li>
<li><em>Phèdre</em> - Phèdre</li>
<li><em>First Aid Kit</em> – Lion’s Roar</li>
<li><em>Menomena</em> – Moms</li>
<li><em>Daniel Rosen</em> – Silent Hour/Golden Mile EP</li>
<li><em>Schoolboy Q</em> – Habits and Contradictions</li>
<li><em>Moonface</em> – With Siinai: Heartbreaking Bravery</li>
<li><em>Tame Impala</em> – Lonerism</li>
<li><em>Chelsea Wolfe</em> – Unknown Rooms: A Collection of Acoustic Songs</li>
<li><em>Sleigh Bells</em> – Reign of Terror</li>
<li><em>CATL</em> – Soon This Will All Be Gone</li>
<li><em>Purity Ring</em> – Shrines</li>
</ol>

<p>As tradition dictates, some choice nuggets are included after the jump.</p>

<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: I first listened to this album while reading William Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em>. When I hear this song, I’m jacked in to the matrix, triumphantly punching through ICE. (If you don’t know, read it.)</p>

<p>Toronto folk, you MUST go see these guys live for the full drunken, sweaty, foot-stomping CATL experience. I promise you’ll like it, unless you have no soul.</p>
