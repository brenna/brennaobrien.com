<p>I’ve been enamoured with jazz label Blue Note’s album artwork for quite some time now, so I decided to bring the Blue Note motif into my latest site design [ed. this was posted on the previous version of my site, pictured above]. I love the simple but bright colour schemes and clean geometric elements.</p>

<p>A great collection of Blue Note cover art can be found at <a href="http://www.birkajazz.com/archive/blueNote10inch.htm">Birka Jazz</a>.</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/almost-blue-album-covers-inspired-by-blue-note-records/">The Font Feed</a> for helping track down some of Blue Note’s favourite fonts.</p>
