<p>Toronto art school OCAD University has an innovative new visual identity, courtesy of Bruce Mau Design. The simple black and white logo includes a “window” that will house variable content, including student artwork that is selected each year. Take a look <a href="http://www2.ocad.ca/visualidentity/" title="OCAD University identity">here</a>.</p>

<p>MIT Media Lab came up with an equally impressive dynamic identity earlier this year. The algorithmically generated logo has 40,000 (!) unique permutations based off a few simple shapes and colours. I’ve never seen anything like <a href="http://www.rt80.net/medialab/" title="MIT Media Lab identity">this</a> before and was instantly impressed.</p>

<p>Both techniques are wonderfully clever ways to keep a logo fresh and lively. It’s also great to see dynamic design like this applied to traditionally static content. Welcome to the 21st century, logo design. It’s nice to have you here.</p>
