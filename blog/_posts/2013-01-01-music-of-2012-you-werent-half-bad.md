“*I briefly forgot that I can accomplish anything if I’ve got good music playing. Let’s not do that again.*” - [a couple months ago][1]

Though I constantly lamented the lack of new music I’d been listening to this year, and even at times, feared a good-music drought was upon us, it turns out the situation was not so bleak.

When I finally took stock and attempted Ye Olde Top 10 List, I once again came out with at least 20 great albums. This is the music that moved me the most:

1.  Grimes - *Visions*
2.  Father John Misty - *Fear Fun*
3.  Frank Ocean - *Channel Orange*
4.  Grizzly Bear - *Shields*
5.  Sharon Van Etten - *Tramp*
6.  Kendrick Lamar - *Good Kid M.A.A.D. City*
7.  Yeasayer - *Fragrant World*
8.  Flying Lotus - *Until the Quiet Comes*
9.  Twin Shadow - *Confess*
10. Phèdre - *Phèdre*
11. First Aid Kit - *Lion’s Roar*
12. Menomena - *Moms*
13. Daniel Rosen - *Silent Hour/Golden Mile EP*
14. Schoolboy Q - *Habits and Contradictions*
15. Moonface - *With Siinai: Heartbreaking Bravery*
16. Tame Impala - *Lonerism*
17. Chelsea Wolfe - *Unknown Rooms: A Collection of Acoustic Songs*
18. Sleigh Bells - *Reign of Terror*
19. CATL - *Soon This Will All Be Gone*
20. Purity Ring - *Shrines*

As tradition dictates, some choice nuggets are included after the jump.



**Fun fact**: I first listened to this album while reading William Gibson’s *Neuromancer*. When I hear this song, I’m jacked in to the matrix, triumphantly punching through ICE. (If you don’t know, read it.)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


Toronto folk, you MUST go see these guys live for the full drunken, sweaty, foot-stomping CATL experience. I promise you’ll like it, unless you have no soul.
