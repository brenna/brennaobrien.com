A holdover from my days working at a record store, the year end top 10 list has become a personal tradition. This one was tough. It was a good year according to my musical tastes, plus I’m notoriously indecisive when picking favourites (“I love all my children equally!”).

After countless edits, I give you my — *loosely* ranked in order of preference, liable to change at any second — top 20 albums of 2011:

1.  *Destroyer* – Kaputt
2.  *St. Vincent* – Strange Mercy
3.  *Childish Gambino* – Camp
4.  *Beirut* – The Rip Tide
5.  *Tune Yards* – WHOKILL
6.  *Braids* – Native Speaker
7.  *Kurt Vile* – Smoke Ring for My Halo
8.  *Fleet Foxes* – Helplessness Blues
9.  *Toro y Moi* – Underneath the Pine
10. *Little Dragon* – Ritual Union
11. *Timber Timbre* – Creep On Creepin’ On
12. *Feist* – Metals
13. *Lykke Li* – Wounded Rhymes
14. *Noah Gundersen* – Family EP
15. *Bon Iver -* Bon Iver
