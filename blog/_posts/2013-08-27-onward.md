title: Onward!
layout: blog_post
intro: When I graduated with a Math and Physics degree and few meaninful job options, everyone told me I should teach. "Are you kidding me? I haven't got the patience for that!"
---

So I didn't teach.

And the job options remained scarce. Two years after that expensive degree, I was working three part time jobs and still worrying about where my rent was going to come from. 

That wasn't going to cut it.

So I scoured the program listings of every college within TTC radius, in search of something interesting that someone would pay me to do. I settled on a six month Web Dev & Design crash course at Humber. I commuted to Rexdale every week day, dusted off my keener tendencies, and came out of it all with a good enough portfolio to land me a junior dev job at a [small agency](http://filamentlab.com).

###I get bored easily

- talk about teaching yourself lots, especially due to lack of up-to-date curriculum
- started volunteering with LLC to pay forward the knowledge sharing (and to support their mission of helping women learn to code) 
- found it incredibly rewarding
- led my first workshop, and it went really well

I am happy to annouce that I'll be joining the HackerYou family as an full-time instuctor for a new web dev "boot camp" course. When Heather pitched me the idea, I once again stood behind her vision of disrupting tech education. LLC and HackerYou have made tremendous strides in facilitating innovative learning in Toronto, and I'm extremely excited to be part of this next step.
