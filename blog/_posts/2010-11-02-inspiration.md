I’ve been enamoured with jazz label Blue Note’s album artwork for quite some time now, so I decided to bring the Blue Note motif into my latest site design \[ed. this was posted on a previous version of my site, pictured above\]. I love the simple but bright colour schemes and clean geometric elements.

A great collection of Blue Note cover art can be found at [Birka Jazz][1].

Many thanks to [The Font Feed][2] for helping track down some of Blue Note’s favourite fonts.
