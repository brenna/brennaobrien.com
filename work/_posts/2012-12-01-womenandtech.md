I've had the pleasure of working with a talented and inspiring bunch of designers and developers on Women&&Tech. Based here in Toronto, and borne out of the difficulty of finding female speakers at tech events, we aim to share the stories of women doing great work in the tech industry. An ever evolving project, I contribute strategy, content and front and back end code to this responsive build.
