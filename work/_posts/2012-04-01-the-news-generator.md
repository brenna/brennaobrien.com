[Filament](http://filamentlab.com) did a complete overhaul of the branding, marketing site and web app for custom press release service, The News Generator. Tasked with creating a consistent experience across both the marketing site and web app, this was one of the first sites I created a [style guide](http://www.thenewsgenerator.com/style-guide/) for. It helped me get other devs up to speed quickly and also served as a reference for future design. It worked out so well, I now create a style guide for nearly every project I work on. 

Having used LESS a few times before, this project also marked my conversion over to [Sass](http://sasslang.org), a more robust and module-friendly pre-processor.
