A fun project for a great cause, [Filament](http://filamentlab.com) and [Smith Roberts](http://www.smithrobertsandco.com/) teamed up to make the [Nature Conservancy of Canada](http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/)'s conservation project come to life. I built out the interactive front-end for both deskotp and mobile, including some custom JavaScript scrolling behaviour to guide you through your journey, and my infamous CSS [hexagon animals](http://codepen.io/brenna/full/hbDqL). Plus, I can now tell you how much a moose weighs (up to 1,500 lbs!).
