[Learning Labs](http://learninglabs.org) is a new online hub for digital literacy programs across Canada, and I had the pleasure of making it come to life through code.  Starting with a beautiful and engaging design from [Studio Function](http://studiofunction.com/), I had a lot of fun implementing front-end flourishes like animated 3-D flips, subtle parallax effects, and killer typography (all in Sass, of course). I also had a blast playing around with the [JSON API for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/) plugin and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to devliver a rich, app-like epxerience for browing events.
