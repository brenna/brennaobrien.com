Back when most people thought HTML5 was only good for getting videos to show up on the iPhone, I set up a quick demo site to show off what was really in store. Reading *Ender's Game* at the time and a chance to play with Illustrator led to the custom solar stytem illustration. 

I also had a lot of fun digging into bleeding-edge demos and info while creating the content here. As a testament to what can already be done in a typical project, the site was built using the new semantic markup elements and a very generous dose of CSS3. And thus my love affair with CSS transitions was borne.
