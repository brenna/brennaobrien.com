CSS Hexagon, Please is a web developer tool for generating pure CSS hexagons with box-shadow, border and background images. This was a fun way for me to give something back to the always helpful web developer community and a perfect chance to dig into [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org). I also really enjoyed the challenge of wrangling some of the new HTML5 input elements like [input[type=range]](http://brennaobrien.com/blog/2014/05/style-input-type-range-in-every-browser.html) and input[type=color].
