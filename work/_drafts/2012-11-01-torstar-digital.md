Leading digital media organization, Torstar Digital, came to us at [Filament Creative](http://filamentlab.com) looking to update their site.  And update we did, with a fully responsive custom WordPress build. I was responsible for developing the responsive theme templates, as well as building out the CMS to accommodate a careers module, personnel profiles, and management of the group's many properties.
