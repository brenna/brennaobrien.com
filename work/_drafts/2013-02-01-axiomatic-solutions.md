A simple one-page responsive site for for boutique writing services firm, Axiomatic Solutions.  I worked on this one from start to finish. Thanks to an easy dev build, I had a lot of fun playing around with typography here, including a scalable, CSS-only brand mark. That said, my favourite part just might be the CSS transitions used to animate the current nav item.
