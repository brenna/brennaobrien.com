  <h1>Want to try speaking at a tech conference?</h1>

    <p class="punch">
      Are you intimidated by the process and getting on stage?
      Don't know where to start?
      Unsure if you have something valuable to say?
    </p>

    <h2 class="blue bold">I'm here to help</h2>

    <p>Speaking at tech conferences is a great way to gain career confidence, meet your peers, travel the world, get recognition for your work, and share your great ideas with the community. <strong>But it can be intimidating, especially if you've never navigated this scene before.</strong></p>

    <p>It was scary for me too when I first started, but with years of <a href="/speaking">successful conference talks</a> under my belt and my experience working at <a href="http://ted.com">TED</a>, I've now got a great process for writing killer proposals, putting together a meaningful and memorable talk, and getting over those on-stage public speaking nerves. And I want to share that wisdom with you.</p>

    <p><strong>If you're part of a marginalized group, I especially want your voice to be heard.</strong><br> But I also know you have to fight just to get a seat at the tech table, and you may be at a financial disadvantage due to your race, gender or other factors. I offer sliding scale pricing for those identifying with a minority group on a case by case basis. <a href="mailto:coaching@brennaobrien.com?subject=coaching%20diversity%20discount">Let's talk about it.</a></p>

    <h3 id="partnerships">Partner with me</h3>
    <p class="punch m-b-1">Are you a startup, tech company, or just a nice person who wants to help with speaker diversity in the tech industry? <p>
    <p><strong>Put your money where your mouth is by sponsoring a diversity scholarship.</strong><br> You contribution will go directly to funding the cost of my services for a speaker in a marginalized group so that their voice can be heard. Marginalized people need to see themselves in the positions they aspire to. Your contribution will not only help the career of the speaker in question, but inspire others in the same group to get up on stage and share their diverse perspectives. </p>
